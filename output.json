That's right, talent anyone that knows me doesn't understand how I can sit and do what looks like to them the same thing over and over again for hours on end.  Well that's easy because it's all in the passion, I love to sit and use strategical methods to figure things out, where I am getting shot from, where I can go to not get caught.  My wife can't stand it when all of a sudden she hears there's a glitch, someone is hacking the game, she thinks I am just a big kid.  I on the other hand love it it's calming to do this because I understand it and am at one with a game when I am sitting down \"playing\" away.  I have the special skills to sit and play for 10+ hours at a time, it's really in the way a person is cut out and willing to spend the time it takes that determines if you have it, and I have been doing it since the Atari system a well established 25 years under my thumbs.  \n  My goal is to help companies get the games on the shelves sooner than later, with little to no flaws in it.  I want people to like playing the games as much as I do.
