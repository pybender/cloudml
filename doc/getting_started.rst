Getting started
===============

CloudML aims to provide a set of tools that allow building a classifier on the
cloud. It consists of three components:

1. Import handler, a utility module that is responsible for feeding the trainer and the predictor with data.
2. Predictor, that uses a model produced by the trainer to predict the class of incoming requests,
3. Trainer, which receives data from the import handler and trains a classifier to produce a classification model.


Describe features
=================

For create new model you should describe model features using json. You can found info about format in :ref:`Feature JSON file format<features>` chapter of this documentaion.
